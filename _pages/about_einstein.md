Welcome to my website. This is me. I am still learning to embrace the idea that
in the first half of my twenties, I don't have to know who I am and where I want
to go. 

My main motivation to create this website is having a space to write about things
that I have learned and ideas that I want to share. Now that I set up the space, 
I have no excuse not to use it.
