Hi. <br>
This is me. âœ¨ ðŸ˜„ <br>
<span style="color:blue">some *blue* text</span>

I am still learning to embrace the idea that in the first half of my twenties, 
I don't have to know **who** I am *and* _where_ I want to go. 

My main motivation to create this website is having a space to write about things
that I have learned and ideas that I want to share. Now that I set up the space, 
I have no excuse not to use it.
