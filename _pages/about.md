Hi. <br>
<span style="color:orange">This</span> is me. <br>

I am still learning to embrace the idea that in the first half of my twenties, 
it is okay to not have figured everything out. So far I have learned that I enjoy
stories of all kinds and have fun learning new things, especially languages. 
I am fairly certain that I adore horses (it's hard to ignore how happy I am every time I see one).
Apart from that, I also study Machine Learning at KTH (Kungliga Tekniska Högskola). 
Before that I was learning about Cognitive Science in Tübingen and am still very
curious about everything that has to do with the brain. And before that, I grew up
in southern Germany right next to the Alps which is why I also love to be in nature and go on hikes.

My main motivation to create this website is having a space to write about things
that I have learned and ideas that I want to share. Now that I set up the space, 
I have no excuse not to use it.
