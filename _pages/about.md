Hi. <br>

I am a research intern at [Sahar Abdelnabis](https://s-abdelnabi.github.io/#positions) COMPASS group, working on safe AI systems.

<br> 
I hold a master's degree in Machine Learning from KTH (Kungliga Tekniska Högskola) and a bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science from University of Tübingen. During the course of my studies, I was engaged in projects studying visual perception, learning in the basal ganglia, uncertainty in neural networks (vs. humans), and calibration. Most recently, I continued my [master's thesis](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1986685&dswid=5996) project as a Research Engineer, exploring how flatness promoting techniques can improve posterior approximations.

<br> 
Studying German Sign Language during my voluntary social year sparked my interest in language learning. I am enjoy learning new languages and am also happy to help other people with their German. If you are interested in a language exchange, feel free to reach out to me. I would be excited to improve my French and keep my Swedish alive.
